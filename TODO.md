# Serax Page Sort Feature Duplication Fix

## Issue
The sort feature on Serax production page appears 3 times instead of once for each category:
- Accessories (showing 3 times)
- Lighting (showing 3 times)

## Root Cause
Broken useEffect hook in `app/serax/page.tsx`:
- Missing `fetchData()` function call
- Missing closing brace for useEffect
- Could be causing multiple re-renders

## Tasks
- [x] Identify the issue in the useEffect hook
- [x] Fix the broken useEffect hook
- [x] Test the fix to ensure categories appear only once
- [x] Verify filtering and sorting functionality works

## Files to Edit
- `app/serax/page.tsx` - Fix broken useEffect hook ✅

## Status
✅ COMPLETED - The sort feature duplication issue has been successfully fixed!

## Test Results
- ✅ Page loads successfully without errors
- ✅ Categories display correctly: "All", "Accessories", "Lighting" (each appears only once)
- ✅ No more duplicate category buttons
- ✅ Products are fetched and displayed properly (8 Serax products found)
- ✅ Filtering functionality works as expected
- ✅ Page performance is normal with proper useEffect execution

## Fix Summary
The issue was caused by a broken useEffect hook in `app/serax/page.tsx`:
- Missing `fetchData()` function call
- Missing closing brace for the useEffect
- This caused improper component initialization and potential re-renders

The fix involved:
1. Adding the missing `fetchData()` call inside the useEffect
2. Adding the proper closing brace and dependency array `}, []);`
3. Ensuring the useEffect runs only once on component mount
