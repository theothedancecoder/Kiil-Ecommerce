# Brand Pages Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Serax Page Sort Feature Duplication
**Problem:** Categories appeared 3 times instead of once each (Accessories x3, Lighting x3)
**Root Cause:** Broken useEffect hook missing fetchData() call and closing brace
**Solution:** Fixed useEffect hook and used hardcoded categories to prevent duplicates

### 2. Flos Page Category Duplication  
**Problem:** Categories appeared multiple times (All, FLOS, Lighting x3)
**Root Cause:** getFlosCategories() returning duplicate categories from Sanity
**Solution:** Used hardcoded categories like Serax to avoid duplicates

### 3. Serax Footer Removal
**Problem:** Footer section needed to be removed from Serax page
**Solution:** Removed the "Brand Story Section" with blue background
