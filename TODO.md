# Louis Poulsen AJ Floor Product Page Fix

## Issue
The URL `https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/louis-poulsen/aj-floor` shows "Product not found" because:
- URL uses `aj-floor` as product ID
- Static data has product with ID `aj-floor-lamp` 
- Product page only uses static data, not Sanity CMS integration

## Tasks
- [x] Update static product data to include proper slug mapping
- [x] Fix product page to integrate Sanity CMS with fallback to static data
- [x] Add flexible product lookup (by ID, slug, or URL matching)
- [x] Test the fixed URL works correctly
- [x] Verify other Louis Poulsen products still work

## Progress
- [x] Analyzed the issue and identified root cause
- [x] Created comprehensive plan
- [x] Update static product data (changed href from /louis-poulsen/aj-floor-lamp to /louis-poulsen/aj-floor)
- [x] Update product page component (added Sanity integration with fallback to static data)
- [x] Fixed TypeScript errors and image handling
- [x] Test implementation - SUCCESS! ✅

## Test Results
✅ **Local Development**: http://localhost:3000/louis-poulsen/aj-floor works perfectly
- Product loads correctly with proper breadcrumbs (Home / Louis Poulsen / AJ Floor)
- Shows correct product information (AJ Floor, kr 6,800)
- Displays product image and specifications
- Related products section works
- Sanity integration working (console shows both Sanity and static image processing)

⚠️ **Production**: https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/louis-poulsen/aj-floor still shows "Product not found"
- This is expected as the changes haven't been deployed to production yet
- Once deployed, the production site will work with the same fix
