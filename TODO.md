# Serax Pages Fix - TODO

## Plan: Fix Serax pages to use Sanity CMS consistently (like Flos approach)

### Tasks:
- [x] Update Serax main page (`app/serax/page.tsx`):
  - [x] Replace static product data with Sanity CMS data using `getSeraxProducts()`
  - [x] Use consistent approach like Flos (without ProductGridItem for now)
  - [x] Add proper loading states and error handling
  - [x] Maintain the same visual design but with dynamic data

- [x] Update Serax individual page (`app/serax/[productId]/page.tsx`):
  - [x] Ensure it uses the same data structure as the main page
  - [x] Remove static product data and use Sanity consistently
  - [x] Simplified to pass params to client component (like Flos approach)

- [x] Test navigation flow:
  - [x] Both pages now use Sanity CMS consistently
  - [x] Eliminated data structure mismatches that caused freezing
  - [x] Simplified approach similar to Flos implementation
  - [x] **PRODUCTION TESTING COMPLETED**: All navigation works without freezing

### Progress:
- [x] Plan created and approved
- [x] Main page updated
- [x] Individual page updated
- [x] Testing completed
- [x] **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION AND TESTED SUCCESSFULLY**
- [x] **IMAGES FIXED AND UPLOADED TO SANITY**

## Summary of Changes Made:

### Fixed Issues:
- **Root Cause**: Serax had a hybrid approach with static data on main page and Sanity data on individual pages
- **Problem**: Data structure mismatches caused navigation freezing between pages
- **Solution**: Made both pages use Sanity CMS consistently like the Flos implementation

### Files Updated:
1. **`app/serax/page.tsx`**: 
   - Replaced static hardcoded product data with Sanity CMS data
   - Added proper loading states and error handling
   - Used `getSeraxProducts()` and `getSeraxCategories()` functions
   - Maintained the same visual design but with dynamic data

2. **`app/serax/[productId]/page.tsx`**: 
   - Removed static product data completely
   - Simplified to pass params to SeraxProductClient (like Flos approach)
   - Now uses consistent Sanity data structure

### Result:
- ✅ No more freezing when navigating between Serax pages
- ✅ Consistent data source (Sanity CMS) across all Serax pages
- ✅ Simpler, more maintainable code structure
- ✅ Follows the same pattern as the working Flos implementation
