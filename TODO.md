# DUX Production Individual Pages Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Resolved
DUX production individual pages weren't showing images and variants because they were using hardcoded static data instead of the Sanity-powered DuxProductClient component.

## Root Cause
The `app/dux/[productId]/page.tsx` file contained 500+ lines of hardcoded static data instead of using the Sanity-powered approach like other brands.

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Step 1**: Identified the issue (hardcoded data vs Sanity data)
- ✅ **Step 2**: Confirmed Sanity data is working (12 products with images and variants)
- ✅ **Step 3**: Updated `app/dux/[productId]/page.tsx` to use DuxProductClient (replaced 500+ lines with 20-line implementation)
- ✅ **Step 4**: Fixed query structure in `getDuxProducts.ts` (changed from category lookup to `brand == "DUX"`)
- ✅ **Step 5**: Verified all DUX product pages work correctly

## Test Results ✅
- ✅ Jetson Match Flax Chair page loads with images and variants
- ✅ All 12 DUX products accessible via Sanity
- ✅ Variant selection and add-to-cart functionality working
- ✅ No console errors, proper image loading

# FLOS Production Individual Pages Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Resolved
FLOS production individual pages weren't showing images due to missing `getFlosProductBySlug` function causing 400 errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Critical Missing Function**: `FlosProductClient.tsx` was calling `getFlosProductBySlug()` but this function didn't exist in `getFlosProducts.ts`
- **Incomplete Query Structure**: Existing queries weren't fetching image asset URLs, variants, lifestyle images, or related products
- **Type Mismatch**: No proper `FlosProduct` interface defined

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Missing Function**: Added `getFlosProductBySlug()` function to `getFlosProducts.ts`
- ✅ **Enhanced Queries**: Updated all queries to include proper image asset URLs, variants, lifestyle images, and related products
- ✅ **Type Definition**: Added comprehensive `FlosProduct` interface matching DUX pattern
- ✅ **Query Consistency**: Made all FLOS queries consistent with working DUX implementation
- ✅ **Production Fix**: Deployed fix to resolve 400 errors and missing images

## Technical Changes Made
- **File**: `sanity/lib/products/getFlosProducts.ts`
  - Added missing `getFlosProductBySlug(slug: string): Promise<FlosProduct | null>` function
  - Added comprehensive `FlosProduct` interface with all required fields
  - Enhanced all queries to include `asset-> { _id, url }` for proper image URLs
  - Added support for variants, lifestyleImages, relatedProducts, features, specifications
  - Updated return types from `Product[]` to `FlosProduct[]` for type safety

## Test Results ✅
- ✅ FLOS 2097/18 Chandelier page now loads with proper product data
- ✅ Fixed 400 console errors that were preventing image loading
- ✅ Main product images, variant thumbnails, and lifestyle images now display correctly
- ✅ Variant selection functionality working (Brass, Chrome, Matt Black, Matt White)
- ✅ Add-to-cart functionality operational
- ✅ Navigation and breadcrumbs working correctly
- ✅ Professional product page layout maintained

## Final Status
Both DUX and FLOS production individual pages are now fully functional with proper Sanity data integration, images, variants, and all e-commerce features working correctly. The missing function issue has been resolved and images should now load properly on production.
