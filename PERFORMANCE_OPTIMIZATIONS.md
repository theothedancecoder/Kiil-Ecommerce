# Homepage Performance Optimizations

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **allProducts.ts**: Converted to lazy loading pattern to reduce initial bundle size
- **ClientHeader.tsx**: Split client-side components from server components
- **LanguageToggle**: Made lazy-loaded with dynamic import

### 2. Image Optimizations
- Added `loading="lazy"` to non-critical images
- Added blur placeholders for better perceived performance
- Optimized image sizes and formats in next.config.ts
- Extended cache TTL to 30 days for images

### 3. Component Architecture
- **OptimizedHeader.tsx**: Server component for static parts
- **ClientHeader.tsx**: Client component only for interactive parts
- Reduced hydration overhead by minimizing client-side JavaScript

### 4. Next.js Configuration
- Enabled package import optimization for heavy libraries
- Added WebP/AVIF image format support
- Configured proper caching headers
- Enabled SWC minification and console removal in production

### 5. Bundle Analysis
- Added bundle analysis script to monitor performance
- Created npm scripts for performance monitoring

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimizations:
- Large allProducts.ts file loaded on every page
- Heavy client-side hydration
- Unoptimized images without lazy loading
- No code splitting for heavy components

### After Optimizations:
- ✅ Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- ✅ Split server/client components reduce hydration time
- ✅ Optimized images with blur placeholders
- ✅ Better caching strategies
- ✅ Package import optimization

## Monitoring Performance

### Run Bundle Analysis:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

### Build with Analysis:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** - Should be < 1.8s
2. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Should be < 2.5s
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Should be < 0.1
4. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Should be < 100ms

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Further Code Splitting
Consider splitting more components:
- Brand collection section
- Newsletter signup
- Category cards

### 2. Service Worker
Implement service worker for:
- Asset caching
- Offline functionality
- Background sync

### 3. Database Optimization
- Implement proper indexing
- Use connection pooling
- Consider CDN for static assets

### 4. Monitoring Tools
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Lighthouse CI
- Web Vitals monitoring
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)

## Testing Performance

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Build and start production server
npm run build
npm start

# Test with Lighthouse
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
```

### Production Testing:
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Test on various devices and network conditions
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
