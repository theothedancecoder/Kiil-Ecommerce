# Sibast Production Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
Individual Sibast pages showing 404/broken images on production at https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/sibast/no-7-dining-chair

## Root Cause
Missing `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` in page.tsx, which Umage has but Sibast was missing.

## Solution Applied (Commit 636a290)

### 1. Updated app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx
Added the EXACT same configuration as Umage:
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export const revalidate = 1800; // 30 minutes (changed from 3600)
```

### 2. Reverted next.config.ts
Reverted to commit b8b6eb7 (the working Umage version) - removed `unoptimized: true`

## Verification

### Sanity Data ✅
- All 3 Sibast products exist in Sanity
- All have proper Sanity CDN URLs (https://cdn.sanity.io/...)
- No.7 Dining Chair has 11 variants with correct images
- Tested with scripts/test-sibast-production-data.mjs

### Code Structure ✅
- page.tsx: Matches Umage implementation exactly
- SibastProductClient.tsx: Uses ProductionImage component (same as Umage)
- ProductionImage.tsx: Detects Sanity CDN URLs and uses native <img> tags
- getAllProductsSimple.ts: Returns proper image.asset.url structure

### Configuration ✅
- `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` - enables dynamic rendering
- `revalidate = 1800` - 30 minute cache (same as Umage)
- `generateStaticParams()` - pre-generates pages at build time
- `dynamicParams = true` - allows new products to render

## Deployment Status

**Commits:**
- 636a290: Main fix (add force-dynamic, revert next.config)
- 9ace0f3: Force deployment trigger

**Status:** Waiting for Vercel to deploy (typically 2-5 minutes)

## Expected Result

Once Vercel deployment completes:
1. Page will load successfully
2. Images will display from Sanity CDN
3. ProductionImage will use native <img> tags for Sanity URLs
4. No 400 errors

## Why This Will Work

This is the EXACT same implementation that makes Umage work in production:
- Same page.tsx structure
- Same dynamic/revalidate configuration  
- Same ProductionImage component
- Same Sanity data structure
- Same next.config.ts

The only difference was the missing `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` line, which is now added.
