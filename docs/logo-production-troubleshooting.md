# Logo Production Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status ✅

**Logo Configuration**: The logo is properly configured in Sanity and should load from CDN.

- **Sanity Document**: ✅ Homepage document exists (ID: c1a2I8fB7DwQuylEu8Ftlh)
- **Logo Asset**: ✅ Logo uploaded to Sanity CDN
- **CDN URL**: https://cdn.sanity.io/images/hi84i3u4/production/8629d21b1a399dc9b52450922981c803704888c8-819x255.png
- **Fallback Image**: ✅ `/kiil-black-square-bla.png` exists in public folder
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Properly configured locally

## Production Issue Diagnosis

Since the logo works locally but not in production, the issue is likely one of these:

### 1. Environment Variables Missing in Production ⚠️
**Most Common Issue**: Production deployment platform missing environment variables.

**Check**: Verify these are set in your production environment (Vercel/Netlify/etc.):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=hi84i3u4
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-06-13
```

**Solution**: Add missing environment variables to your deployment platform.

### 2. Sanity Client Configuration Issues
**Issue**: Production client might not be connecting to Sanity properly.

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check browser console for Sanity-related errors
2. Look for network requests to `hi84i3u4.api.sanity.io`
3. Verify CDN requests to `cdn.sanity.io`

### 3. Image Processing Errors
**Issue**: The `getImageUrl()` function might be failing silently in production.

**Current Implementation**: Uses fallback mechanism, but errors might not be visible.

### 4. Async Component Hydration Issues
**Issue**: The `SiteLogo` component is async and might have hydration problems.

**Symptoms**: Logo appears briefly then disappears, or never loads.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Add Environment Variable
Add this to your production environment:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2025-06-13
```

### Solution 2: Enhanced Error Logging
The current `SiteLogo` component fails silently. We need better error handling.

### Solution 3: Verify Deployment Environment
Run these commands to verify your production setup:

```bash
# Test logo configuration
node scripts/verify-logo-sanity.js

# Diagnose production issues
node scripts/diagnose-production-logo.js
```

## Production Debugging Checklist

When logo doesn't load in production:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check for failed network requests
   - Verify Sanity API calls

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for failed requests to `*.api.sanity.io`
   - Check CDN requests to `cdn.sanity.io`
   - Verify image URLs are accessible

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Check deployment platform settings
   - Ensure all `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_*` variables are set
   - Verify values match local `.env.local`

4. **Test Fallback Behavior**
   - Check if `/kiil-black-square-bla.png` loads directly
   - Verify fallback logic is working

5. **Check Sanity Studio**
   - Verify logo is still uploaded and published
   - Check if asset URL is accessible
   - Ensure no content changes broke the reference

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Force Fallback (Temporary)
If you need immediate fix, temporarily force fallback:

```tsx
// In SiteLogo.tsx - temporary fix
const logoUrl = "/kiil-black-square-bla.png"; // Force fallback
```

### Fix 2: Add Error Boundary
Wrap the logo component in an error boundary to catch issues.

### Fix 3: Add Logging
Add console.log statements to track where the loading fails.

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhanced SiteLogo component with better error handling
2. **Add Monitoring**: Set up error monitoring for production
3. **Implement Retry Logic**: Add retry mechanism for failed Sanity requests
4. **Cache Optimization**: Implement better caching strategy

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify current logo setup
node scripts/verify-logo-sanity.js

# Diagnose production issues
node scripts/diagnose-production-logo.js

# Test fallback behavior
node scripts/test-fallback-behavior.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Check your production environment variables first
2. If variables are correct, implement enhanced error handling
3. Add production monitoring to catch future issues
4. Consider implementing a more robust image loading strategy

The logo should work in production once environment variables are properly configured!
