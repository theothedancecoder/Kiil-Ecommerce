# Møbler Page Complete Fix Summary

## Issue
Products were not showing on the møbler page (https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/mobler) because they were missing category assignments in Sanity CMS.

## Root Cause
The møbler page filters products by checking if they have furniture-related categories. Products without categories were being excluded from the display.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified Missing Categories
- Created diagnostic script: `scripts/check-all-products-without-categories.mjs`
- Found **59 products** across **9 brands** without categories:
  - FLOS: 1 product
  - Fredericia: 11 products
  - Fritz Hansen: 9 products
  - HAY: 8 products
  - Juul: 2 products
  - Kartell: 9 products
  - Montana: 1 product
  - Skagerak by Fritz Hansen: 12 products
  - Soren Lund: 3 products
  - Vitra: 3 products
  - Vipp: 2 products (added separately)

### 2. Added Categories to All Products
- Created script: `scripts/add-categories-to-all-products.mjs`
- Automatically assigned appropriate categories based on product names:
  - **Seating**: Chairs, armchairs, stools, benches, sofas
  - **Tables**: Dining tables, coffee tables, side tables, desks
  - **Lighting**: Lamps, pendants, floor lamps, table lamps
  - **Storage**: Componibili, shelving units
  - **Accessories**: Clocks, parasols, cushions, decorative items
  - **Furniture**: General furniture items

### 3. Vipp Products
- Created script: `scripts/add-vipp-categories.mjs`
- Added Storage category to:
  - Chimney Shelf 60cm (vipp478-chimney-shelf-60)
  - Chimney Shelf 120cm (vipp479-chimney-shelf-120)
