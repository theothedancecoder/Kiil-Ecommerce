# ðŸ”’ Sanity Products Hidden from Webapp

## **Status: âœ… All Sanity products are now hidden from the webapp**

Your webapp now shows only the static products from `lib/allProducts.ts` while keeping all Sanity products safely stored in your CMS.

---

## **What Was Modified:**

### **Files Updated to Hide Sanity Products:**
1. **`sanity/lib/products/getAllProducts.ts`** - Returns empty array instead of fetching products
2. **`sanity/lib/products/getProductsWithCategories.ts`** - Returns empty array
3. **`sanity/lib/products/getProductByCategory.ts`** - Returns empty array
4. **`sanity/lib/products/searchProductsByName.ts`** - Returns empty array
5. **`sanity/lib/products/getProductBySlug.ts`** - Returns null

### **What's Still Working:**
- âœ… **Static products** from `lib/allProducts.ts` display normally
- âœ… **Quantity selectors** work on all products
- âœ… **Stock management** system still functional
- âœ… **Sanity Studio** still accessible at `http://localhost:3000/studio`
- âœ… **All Sanity data** remains intact in your CMS
