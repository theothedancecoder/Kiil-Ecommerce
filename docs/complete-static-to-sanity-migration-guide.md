# Complete Static to Sanity Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate all remaining static products from `lib/allProducts.ts` to Sanity CMS, solving the production image issues.

## üéØ Goal

Migrate all static products to Sanity CMS so that:
- ‚úÖ Images work reliably in production (served from Sanity CDN)
- ‚úÖ All products are managed through Sanity Studio
- ‚úÖ No more static image path issues on Vercel

## üìä Current Status

- **‚úÖ Already Migrated:** UMAGE, FLOS, Fredericia (149+ products)
- **‚è≥ Pending Migration:** HAY, Fritz Hansen, Kartell, Montana, Vitra, DUX, Eilersen, Soren Lund, &Tradition, Audo Copenhagen, RO Collection, Jonas Ihreborn, Juul, Sibast Furniture

## üöÄ Migration Process

### Step 1: Check Current Status

First, verify what needs to be migrated:

```bash
node scripts/verify-migration-status.js
```

This will show you:
- How many products are in each brand
- Which brands are complete vs pending
- Products with missing images

### Step 2: Run the Migration

Execute the comprehensive migration script:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-remaining-static-products.js
```

**What this script does:**
- ‚úÖ Processes products one by one (no freezing)
- ‚úÖ Skips already migrated brands (UMAGE, FLOS, Fredericia)
- ‚úÖ Uploads all images to Sanity CDN
- ‚úÖ Creates categories automatically
- ‚úÖ Handles variants and lifestyle images
- ‚úÖ Provides detailed progress reporting
- ‚úÖ Includes error handling and retry logic

### Step 3: Verify Migration Results

After migration, check the results:

```bash
node scripts/verify-migration-status.js
```

### Step 4: Enable Sanity Products

Once migration is complete, update your environment:

```bash
# In .env.local
USE_SANITY_PRODUCTS=true
```

### Step 5: Test Your Site

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:3000/products` to verify all products load correctly.

2. **Production Testing:**
   Deploy to Vercel and verify images work in production.

### Key Features of Migration Script

```javascript
// Example of what gets migrated for each product:
{
  _id: 'hay-dont-leave-me-dlm-side-table',
  _type: 'product',
  name: "Don't Leave Me - DLM Side Table",
  slug: { current: 'dont-leave-me-dlm-side-table' },
  image: { /* Sanity CDN image */ },
  description: 'Playful and functional side table...',
  price: 2649,
  brand: 'HAY',
  categories: [{ _ref: 'category-tables-id' }],
  variants: [
    {
      name: 'Black',
      image: { /* Sanity CDN image */ },
      color: 'Black',
      price: 2649
    }
    // ... more variants
  ],
  lifestyleImages: [
    { /* Sanity CDN lifestyle images */ }
  ],
  stock: 10,
  inStock: true
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Image not found" warnings**
- Some static images may be missing from `/public` folder
- Script continues and logs warnings
- Products are still created without the missing images

**2. "Category creation failed"**
- Check Sanity API token permissions
- Ensure token has write access to your dataset

**3. "Product already exists"**
- Script automatically skips existing products
- This is normal behavior, not an error

**4. Migration stops/freezes**
- The script processes one product at a time to prevent this
- If it still happens, check your network connection
- Restart the script - it will skip already migrated products

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check migration status
node scripts/verify-migration-status.js

# Test Sanity connection
node scripts/test-sanity-products.js

# Check environment variables
node scripts/test-env-vars.js
```

## üìà Expected Results

After successful migration:

- **~200+ products** migrated to Sanity
- **All images** served from Sanity CDN
- **Categories** automatically created
- **Variants** preserved with images
- **Production images** working reliably

## üéâ Post-Migration Steps

1. **Set environment variable:**
   ```
   USE_SANITY_PRODUCTS=true
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Verify production images work**

5. **Optional cleanup:**
   - Remove static product files (after confirming everything works)
   - Update components to remove static fallbacks
