# Fredericia, Sibast & Soren Lund - Production Fix Complete

## Problem
Individual product pages for these three brands were not showing in production, causing freezing/timeout issues.

## Root Cause
All three brands were using `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` with `getAllProducts()`, which:
1. Fetched ALL products from Sanity on EVERY request
2. Caused heavy processing overhead that froze the process
3. Led to timeouts in production environment

## Solution Applied

### Efficient Data Fetching Strategy
Changed from inefficient `getAllProducts()` to brand-specific optimized functions:

**Before (Causing Freeze):**
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
const allProducts = await getAllProducts(); // Fetches ALL products
const product = allProducts.find(...); // Then filters
```

**After (Efficient):**
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-static"; // Pre-generate at build time
const product = await getBrandProduct(productId); // Direct fetch
const brandProducts = await getBrandProducts(); // Only brand products
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Sibast ✅
**File:** `app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx`
- Changed to `force-static` with ISR (revalidate: 3600)
- Use `getSibastProductBySlug()` for direct fetching
- Use `getSibastProducts()` for related products
- Pages pre-generated at build time

**Sanity Data:**
- 3 products in Sanity
- All have images and variants
- All images from Sanity CDN

### 2. Fredericia ✅
**File:** `app/fredericia/[productId]/page.tsx`
- Changed to `force-static` with ISR (revalidate: 3600)
- Use `getFredericiaProduct()` for direct fetching
- Use `getFredericiaProducts()` for related products
- Pages pre-generated at build time

**Sanity Data:**
- 15 products in Sanity
- All have main images
- All have variants with images
- Verified with `scripts/check-fredericia-sanity.mjs`

### 3. Soren Lund ✅
**File:** `app/soren-lund/[productId]/page.tsx`
- Uses static product data (simplest approach)
- Images use direct Sanity CDN URLs
- `force-static` with ISR
- No Sanity API calls = no freezing

**Sanity Data:**
- 3 products in Sanity
- Brand page fetches from Sanity
- Individual pages use static data for maximum performance

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

**1. Static Generation at Build Time**
- Pages are pre-built during deployment
- No runtime data fetching overhead
- Instant page loads

**2. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**
- Pages revalidate every hour (3600 seconds)
- Fresh content without runtime overhead
- Background updates don't block users

**3. Brand-Specific Queries**
- Only fetch products for the specific brand
- Much faster than fetching all products
- Reduces memory and processing overhead

**4. Direct Product Fetching**
- Get specific product by slug directly
- No need to fetch all products then filter
- Minimal database queries

### Data Flow

```
Build Time:
1. generateStaticParams() → Gets all product slugs for the brand
2. For each slug → Pre-generates static HTML page
3. Stores in Vercel CDN

Runtime (User Request):
1. User visits page → Serves pre-built static page (instant)
2. After 1 hour → Next request triggers revalidation
3. Background rebuild → Updates static page
4. User still sees old page (no waiting)
```

- `SIBAST-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - Documentation

### Fredericia
- `app/fredericia/[productId]/page.tsx` - Optimized with force-static + ISR
- `scripts/check-fredericia-sanity.mjs` - Verification script

### Soren Lund
- `app/soren-lund/[productId]/page.tsx` - Static data with Sanity CDN URLs
- `app/soren-lund/page.tsx` - Brand page with Sanity fetching
- `scripts/migrate-soren-lund-to-sanity.mjs` - Migration script
- `scripts/delete-soren-lund-duplicates.mjs` - Cleanup script

## Deployment

All changes have been pushed to main branch:
- Commit 200f6ad: Sibast optimization
- Commit 7fff6b7: Fredericia optimization
- Commit c602ed9: Soren Lund static data
- Commit 6e99d27: Fredericia verification script

Vercel will automatically:
1. Build static pages for all products
2. Deploy to production
3. Pages will load instantly without freezing

## Verification

### Sanity Data Status
✅ **Sibast:** 3 products with images and variants
✅ **Fredericia:** 15 products with images and variants
✅ **Soren Lund:** 3 products with images

## Expected Results

All pages should now:
- ✅ Load instantly (no freezing)
- ✅ Show images from Sanity CDN
- ✅ Display variants correctly
- ✅ Show related products
- ✅ Work reliably in production

## Why This Pattern Works

This is the same successful pattern used by other brands (RO Collection, Dux, Umage):
- Static generation at build time
- Brand-specific data fetching functions
- ISR for fresh content
- No heavy runtime processing
- Sanity CDN for all images

## Monitoring

After deployment completes (2-5 minutes), verify:
1. Pages load without freezing
2. Images display correctly
3. Variants work properly
4. No console errors
5. Fast page load times

If any issues persist, check:
- Vercel deployment logs
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
