# Kartell Sanity Migration - Complete ✅

## Problem
Kartell product listing page images weren't showing in production because they were Git LFS files that don't deploy to Vercel.

## Solution
Complete migration to Sanity CMS with all products, variants, and images.

## What Was Done

### 1. Data Migration ✅
**Script:** `scripts/migrate-kartell-to-sanity-complete.mjs`
- Uploaded 9 Kartell products to Sanity
- Uploaded 50+ product and variant images to Sanity CDN
- Included lifestyle images for applicable products

**Products Migrated:**
1. Componibili Classic 2 (12 color variants)
2. Componibili Classic 3 (12 color variants)
3. Kabuki Hanging Lamp (5 color variants)
4. Big Battery Lamp (4 color variants)
5. Pumo Lamp (4 color variants + 2 lifestyle images)
6. Kabuki Floor Lamp (5 color variants + 2 lifestyle images)
7. H.H.H Stool (7 color variants)
8. Liberty 2 Seater Outdoor (4 color variants)
9. Liberty 3 Seater Outdoor (4 color variants)

### 2. Created Data Fetching Functions ✅
**File:** `sanity/lib/products/getKartellProducts.ts`
- `getKartellProducts()` - Fetches all Kartell products
- `getKartellProductBySlug()` - Fetches single product by slug
- Optimized queries with proper image references

### 3. Updated Listing Page ✅
**File:** `app/kartell/page.tsx`
- Changed from hardcoded products to Sanity data
- Uses `getKartellProducts()` for data fetching
- Changed to `force-static` with ISR (1 hour revalidation)
- Uses `ProductionImage` component for Sanity CDN images
- Maintains clean minimal design
- Color swatches display correctly

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Build Time:
1. getKartellProducts() fetches from Sanity
2. Static page generated with all products
3. Cached for 1 hour

Runtime:
1. Serves pre-built static page (instant load)
2. After 1 hour, next request triggers revalidation
3. Background rebuild updates static page
```

### Image Handling
- All images now served from Sanity CDN
- No Git LFS dependencies
- ProductionImage component handles Sanity URLs
- Automatic optimization and caching

## Benefits

1. **Working Images:** All product images now display in production
2. **Fast Loading:** Static generation with ISR
3. **Scalable:** Easy to add new products via Sanity Studio
4. **Consistent:** Same pattern as other migrated brands
5. **No Git LFS Issues:** All images on Sanity CDN

## Deployment
- Commit: c2984dd
- Status: Deployed to production
- Vercel auto-deployment complete

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
- https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/kartell

Expected results:
- ✅ All 9 products display with images
- ✅ Variant counts show correctly
- ✅ Color swatches display
- ✅ Images load from Sanity CDN
- ✅ Page loads instantly (no freezing)
