# Sibast Individual Pages Production Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Task Completed Successfully

### Primary Issue: Sibast Individual Pages Freezing - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem:** Sibast individual product pages were freezing/timing out in production, preventing pages from loading.

**Root Cause:** 
- Using `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` 
- Calling `getAllProducts()` which fetched ALL products from Sanity on EVERY request
- Heavy processing overhead froze the process in production

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Changed from `force-dynamic` to `force-static` with ISR
2. ✅ Use `getSibastProductBySlug()` for direct, efficient product fetching
3. ✅ Use `getSibastProducts()` instead of `getAllProducts()`
4. ✅ Pages pre-generated at build time (no runtime freezing)
5. ✅ Revalidate every hour (3600 seconds) for fresh data
6. ✅ All images from Sanity CDN (no Git LFS)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite for efficiency

**Commit:** 200f6ad

**Result:** Sibast pages now load instantly without freezing in production.

## Additional Fixes Completed

### Fritz Hansen Query Schema Fix ✅
**Problem:** Query used `images[]` but schema uses `image`, causing all images to disappear.
**Solution:** Updated `sanity/lib/products/getFritzHansenProducts.ts` to use correct field.
**Commit:** 7ff78bf

### Fritz Hansen Regatta Products ✅
**Problem:** 4 Regatta products had no images.
**Solution:** Uploaded 4 main images to Sanity CDN.
**Commit:** 329fb6e

## Known Limitation

### Fritz Hansen Grand Prix Products (Not Part of Sibast Fix)
**Status:** 3 Grand Prix products don't have source images in the repository.
**Products:** Grand Prix 3130 Chair, 4130 Chair, 4130 Upholstered
**Reason:** No dedicated image folders exist in `public/Fritz Hansen/`
**Note:** This is a separate Fritz Hansen issue, not related to the Sibast fix.
