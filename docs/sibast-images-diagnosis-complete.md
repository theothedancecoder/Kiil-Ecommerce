# Sibast Images Diagnosis - Complete Analysis

## Status: WAITING FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT

## What We Confirmed

### ✅ Images Exist in Sanity
All 3 Sibast products have complete image data:
- **No. 2.1 Dining Table** - 12 variants, all with images
- **No. 7 Dining Chair - Full Upholstery** - 11 variants, all with images  
- **No. 7 Dining Chair** - 11 variants, all with images

### ✅ Sanity CDN URLs Work
Direct test of Sanity CDN URL returned **200 OK**:
```
https://cdn.sanity.io/images/hi84i3u4/production/d346dba946c65b45ed470f60fe66e2cdede0176f-960x960.webp
```

### ✅ Code is Correct
1. **Sibast Page** (`app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx`)
   - Fetches products from Sanity
   - Extracts image URLs: `variant?.image?.asset?.url`
   - Passes string URLs to client component

2. **Sibast Client** (`app/sibast/[productId]/SibastProductClient.tsx`)
   - Uses ProductionImage component (5 instances)
   - Passes image URLs as strings

3. **ProductionImage** (`components/ProductionImage.tsx`)
   - Calls `getImageUrl(src)` to process URLs
   - Detects Sanity CDN: `imageUrl.includes('cdn.sanity.io')`
   - Adds `unoptimized={isSanityCDN}` flag

4. **ImageUrl Helper** (`lib/ImageUrl.ts`)
   - Handles string URLs correctly
   - Returns them as-is if they're valid URLs

5. **Vercel Config** (`vercel.json`)
   - NOW has `cdn.sanity.io` in allowed domains
   - Has remotePatterns configured

## The Issue

The problem was **`vercel.json` was missing Sanity CDN configuration**.

### Before Fix:
```json
"images": {
  "sizes": [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200],
  "minimumCacheTTL": 60
}
```

### After Fix:
```json
"images": {
  "domains": ["cdn.sanity.io"],
  "remotePatterns": [
    {
      "protocol": "https",
      "hostname": "cdn.sanity.io"
    }
  ],
  "sizes": [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200],
  "minimumCacheTTL": 60
}
```

## Why Images Weren't Showing

Without `cdn.sanity.io` in Vercel's allowed domains:
1. Next.js Image component tried to optimize Sanity images
2. Vercel rejected the requests (not in allowed domains)
3. Returned 400 errors
4. Images failed to load

## The Fix

Adding `cdn.sanity.io` to `vercel.json` allows Vercel to:
1. Accept Sanity CDN URLs as valid remote images
2. Either optimize them OR serve them unoptimized (based on our flag)
3. Return successful responses

## Current Status

**Deployment:** In progress (commit a80abe3)
**Expected Result:** Images will load once Vercel redeploys with new vercel.json

## Verification Steps

Once deployment completes:

1. **Test Production Site:**
   ```
   https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/sibast/no-2-1-dining-table
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Should see NO 400 errors
   - Images should load from `https://cdn.sanity.io/...`

3. **Verify Image Loading:**
   - Main product image should display
   - All variant thumbnails should display
   - Related product images should display

## If Images Still Don't Show

### Possible Remaining Issues:

1. **Vercel Cache**
   - Clear Vercel build cache
   - Force redeploy

2. **Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache

3. **Image Optimization Still Active**
   - Check if images go through `/_next/image` API
   - If yes, the `unoptimized` flag isn't working
   - Solution: Use direct `<img>` tag for Sanity images

## Next Actions

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
2. Test production URL
3. Check browser console for errors
4. If still failing, implement direct `<img>` tag fallback
