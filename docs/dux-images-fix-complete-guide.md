# Dux Images Fix - Complete Guide

This document outlines all the steps taken to resolve the Dux images production issue following the same successful approach used for RO Collection.

## 🎯 Original Issue

**Problem**: Dux images not showing on production due to Git LFS files being served as 130-byte pointer files instead of actual images.

**Root Cause**: Git LFS files are served as pointer files on Vercel production instead of actual image content, same issue that affected RO Collection.

**Solution**: Migrate all Dux images from Git LFS static files to Sanity CMS, following the proven RO Collection pattern.

## 📋 Complete Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Upload Main Product Images
**Script**: `scripts/upload-dux-images-to-sanity.mjs`
**Result**: Successfully uploaded 6 main product images to Sanity CDN
- Inter Dining Table
- Jetson Classic Soft 88  
- Jetson Match Flax 21
- Lunaria Table
- Sam Dining Chair
- Superspider Sheepskin

### ✅ Step 2: Create Product Variants
**Script**: `scripts/create-dux-variants.mjs`
**Result**: Successfully created 34 variants with unique images
- Inter Dining Table: 6 variants (different sizes and colors)
- Jetson Classic Soft 88: 2 variants (different leather types)
- Jetson Match Flax 21: 3 variants (different leather combinations)
- Lunaria Table: 9 variants (3 sizes × 3 wood types)
- Sam Dining Chair: 8 variants (4 colors × 2 armrest options)
- Superspider Sheepskin: 6 variants (different sheepskin colors)

### ✅ Step 3: Add Lifestyle Images
**Script**: `scripts/add-dux-lifestyle-images.mjs`
**Result**: Successfully added 10 lifestyle images across all products

### ✅ Step 4: Add Related Products
**Script**: `scripts/add-dux-related-products.mjs`
**Result**: Successfully created 12 product relationships

### ✅ Step 5: Fix Placeholder Images
**Script**: `scripts/fix-dux-placeholder-images.mjs`
**Result**: Replaced 106 placeholder URLs with proper Sanity CDN URLs

### ✅ Step 6: Verify Data Quality
**Script**: `scripts/debug-dux-frontend-urls.mjs`
**Result**: All URLs verified as accessible (HTTP 200) and properly formatted

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Main Dux Collection Page**: All 6 products display correctly with proper images and variant counts
2. **Sanity Data**: All images uploaded successfully with proper CDN URLs
3. **Backend Queries**: All data queries return correct information
4. **ProductionImage Component**: Already uses proper fallback system

### ❌ Issue Remaining
1. **Individual Product Pages**: Still showing empty image placeholders despite perfect Sanity data
2. **Frontend Rendering**: Images not displaying on individual product pages (e.g., `/dux/jetson-classic-soft-88`)

### 🔧 Root Cause Analysis
- **Sanity URLs**: ✅ Perfect (all return HTTP 200)
- **Data Structure**: ✅ Perfect (matches TypeScript interfaces)
- **Component Logic**: ✅ Uses ProductionImage with proper fallbacks
- **Cache Issue**: ❌ Likely cause - static pages generated before images were uploaded

## 🛠️ Current Fix Attempt

### Step 7: Clear Next.js Cache and Rebuild
**Script**: `scripts/clear-nextjs-cache-and-rebuild.mjs`
**Status**: Currently running
**Purpose**: Clear cached static pages and regenerate with correct image data

**Actions Taken**:
1. Remove `.next` directory (Next.js cache)
2. Remove `node_modules/.cache` (build cache)
3. Create cache bust file
4. Rebuild entire project with `npm run build`

## 📊 Data Verification Results

### Main Image Test (jetson-classic-soft-88)
```json
{
  "asset": {
    "_id": "image-15856f953cca9e06f0401e75af20ed318685eb71-1321x1321-jpg",
    "url": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/hi84i3u4/production/15856f953cca9e06f0401e75af20ed318685eb71-1321x1321.jpg"
  }
}
```
**Status**: ✅ URL accessible (HTTP 200)

### Variant Images Test
- Variant 1 (Classic Soft 88 Black): ✅ HTTP 200
- Variant 2 (Classic Soft 25 Brown): ✅ HTTP 200

### Lifestyle Images Test
- Lifestyle Image 1: ✅ HTTP 200

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After the cache clear and rebuild completes:
1. **Individual Product Pages**: Should display all images correctly
2. **Main Images**: Should load from Sanity CDN
3. **Variant Thumbnails**: Should show unique images for each variant
4. **Lifestyle Images**: Should display in the lifestyle section
5. **Related Products**: Should show with proper images

---

## 🔄 Fallback Plan

If cache clear doesn't resolve the issue, next steps:
1. **Check Client-Side Hydration**: Verify data is properly hydrating on client
2. **Add Debug Logging**: Add console logs to ProductionImage component
3. **Test Development vs Production**: Compare behavior in different environments
4. **Force Vercel Redeployment**: Trigger fresh deployment after cache clear

---

## 💡 Key Learnings from RO Collection

1. **Sanity Migration**: Moving from Git LFS to Sanity CDN completely resolves production image issues
2. **Variant Management**: Each variant needs unique, specific images for proper user experience
3. **Cache Management**: Static page generation can cache empty data if images are uploaded after initial build
4. **Production Testing**: Always verify actual URLs are accessible, not just that data exists

---

## 🚀 Success Metrics

When complete, Dux should match RO Collection's success:
- ✅ All main product images loading on individual pages
- ✅ Variant selection showing different images
- ✅ Lifestyle images providing context
- ✅ Related products enhancing discovery
- ✅ No 400/404 errors in browser console
- ✅ Fast loading from Sanity's global CDN
