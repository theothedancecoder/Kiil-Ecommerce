# Vipps Payment Integration Plan for Kiil Ecommerce

## Information Gathered
- Current payment processing uses Stripe with Klarna enabled via Stripe Checkout.
- Stripe does not natively support Vipps as a payment method.
- Vipps provides its own API and test environment with client_id, client_secret, and subscription keys.
- Vipps integration requires partner registration, API key management, and a separate payment flow.
- User has access to Vipps test environment credentials and documentation.

## Plan

### 1. Understand Current Stripe Integration
- Stripe is used via the Stripe Node SDK.
- Checkout sessions are created in `actions/createCheckoutSession.ts`.
- Payment flow is handled via Stripe Checkout URLs.

### 2. Vipps API Integration Overview
- Use Vipps API for payment initiation, authorization, and capture.
- Authenticate API calls using client_id, client_secret, and subscription keys.
- Implement Vipps payment flow including redirect URLs for success and cancellation.
- Handle Vipps webhook notifications for payment status updates.

### 3. System Architecture for Multiple Payment Providers
- Extend backend to support multiple payment providers (Stripe, Vipps).
- Add payment provider selection in checkout flow.
- Abstract payment initiation and confirmation logic to support different providers.
- Store payment provider info and transaction IDs in order metadata.

### 4. Backend Changes
- Create new API endpoints or server actions to handle Vipps payment initiation.
- Implement Vipps API client with authentication and request signing.
- Handle Vipps payment callbacks and webhooks.
- Update order schema to store Vipps payment details.

### 5. Frontend Changes
- Update checkout UI to allow user to select payment method (Stripe/Klarna or Vipps).
- Redirect to Vipps payment URL when Vipps is selected.
- Handle success and cancellation redirects from Vipps.

### 6. Testing
- Use Vipps test environment credentials for integration testing.
- Test full payment flow including success, cancellation, and webhook handling.
- Test fallback and error handling.

### 7. Deployment and Go-Live
- Complete Vipps partner approval process.
- Switch from test to production credentials.
- Monitor payment flows and logs.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `actions/createCheckoutSession.ts` (or create new Vipps payment action)
- Backend API routes or server actions for Vipps
- Frontend checkout components/pages
- Order schema and database models

## Follow-up Steps
- Obtain Vipps API documentation and SDKs if available.
- Implement Vipps API client and payment flow.
- Update UI and backend as per plan.
- Test thoroughly in Vipps test environment.
- Deploy and monitor.
