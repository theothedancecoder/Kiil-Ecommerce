# SIBAST PRODUCTION FIX - FINAL SOLUTION

## Problem
Sibast individual product pages were freezing/timing out in production, preventing pages from loading.

## Root Cause
The page was using `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` with `getAllProducts()`, which:
1. Fetched ALL products from Sanity on EVERY request
2. Caused heavy processing overhead that froze the process
3. Led to timeouts in production environment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed Data Fetching Strategy
**File:** `app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
const allProducts = await getAllProducts(); // Fetches ALL products
const product = allProducts.find(...); // Then filters
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const dynamic = "force-static"; // Pre-generate at build time
const product = await getSibastProductBySlug(productId); // Direct fetch
const allSibastProducts = await getSibastProducts(); // Only Sibast products
```

### 2. Key Changes
- ✅ Changed from `force-dynamic` to `force-static` with ISR
- ✅ Use `getSibastProductBySlug()` for direct, efficient product fetching
- ✅ Use `getSibastProducts()` instead of `getAllProducts()` for related products
- ✅ Pages are pre-generated at build time (no runtime freezing)
- ✅ Revalidate every hour (3600 seconds) for fresh data
- ✅ All images come from Sanity CDN (no Git LFS issues)

### 3. Benefits
1. **No Freezing:** Pages are pre-built, not generated on-demand
2. **Fast Loading:** Static pages load instantly
3. **Efficient:** Only fetches Sibast products, not all products
4. **Scalable:** Works even with large product catalogs
5. **Fresh Data:** ISR ensures content updates within an hour

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Build Time:
1. generateStaticParams() → Gets all Sibast product slugs
2. For each slug → Pre-generates static page
3. Stores in CDN

Runtime:
1. User visits page → Serves pre-built static page (instant)
2. After 1 hour → Next request triggers revalidation
3. Background rebuild → Updates static page
```

### Files Modified
- `app/sibast/[productId]/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite for efficiency

### Files Used (Already Existed)
- `sanity/lib/products/getSibastProducts.ts` - Optimized Sibast-only queries
- `components/ProductionImage.tsx` - Handles Sanity CDN images
- `app/sibast/[productId]/SibastProductClient.tsx` - Client component (unchanged)

## Deployment
Push to main branch and Vercel will automatically:
1. Build static pages for all Sibast products
2. Deploy to production
3. Pages will load instantly without freezing

## Testing
After deployment, test:
- https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/sibast/no-2-1-dining-table
- https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/sibast/no-7-dining-chair
- https://kiil-ecommerce.vercel.app/sibast/no-8-dining-chair

All pages should:
- ✅ Load instantly (no freezing)
- ✅ Show images from Sanity CDN
- ✅ Display variants correctly
- ✅ Show related products

## Why This Works
This is the same pattern used by other successful brands (RO Collection, Dux, etc.):
- Static generation at build time
- Brand-specific data fetching functions
- ISR for fresh content
- No heavy runtime processing
