# ✅ COMPLETED: Serax Sort Feature & Louis Poulsen Individual Product Pages Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Serax Sort Feature Duplication ✅
**Problem**: Categories appeared 3 times instead of once each:
- Accessories (showing 3 times)
- Lighting (showing 3 times)

**Root Cause**: Broken useEffect hook in `app/serax/page.tsx`
- Missing `fetchData()` function call
- Missing closing brace for useEffect

**Solution**: Fixed useEffect with proper function call and closure
**Result**: Categories now display correctly once each

### 2. Louis Poulsen Individual Product Pages ✅
**Problem**: Individual product pages not working with new static system
**Root Cause**: 
- Dynamic page had hardcoded data for only one product
- Image path mismatches between static data and actual files
- Multiple conflicting static product pages

**Solution**: 
- Created unified dynamic `[productId]/page.tsx` using centralized data
- Analyzed and fixed all 159 image file paths
- Removed 16 old static product pages
- Implemented proper variant selection and related products
